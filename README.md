My first exposure to the fastai library involved training resnet on data from the MNIST database. 

The most preferred way to execute this code is to run it on your [personal google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/all2gos/mnist_feat_fastai/blob/main/MNISTxfastai.ipynb) using your [API key for kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api)
